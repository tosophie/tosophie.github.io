				Greetings Sophie.<br>
				It is good to see that you have made it this far.  Sadly, as you may have noticed, you are not yet to the end.  
				This part of your scanvenger hunt will involve something a little more my speed.  Somewhere on this website is
				the message that I hid for you.  Your job is to find it.  I will give you two tips:<br><br>
				
				First, press F12.<br>
				Second, if you really are stuck, either talk to me or add '_help' to the end of the website's url.<br><br>
				
				I hope you don't mind this to much, it just was too fun not to do.<br><br>
				Your friend,<br>
				Mark

			I am fully aware of my terrible web design skills.  I had two weeks, okay!  Also,
